# Maze-Solver
An interactive maze-solving tool supporting both randomly generated and image-based mazes. Implements BFS, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms with real-time path visualization.

Allows users to select start/end points and see animated solutions. Image-based solving uses skeletonization for accurate path extraction.
